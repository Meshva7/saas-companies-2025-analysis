# 📊 SaaS Companies 2025 – Data Analysis (Python + Power BI)

This project analyzes the top 100 SaaS (Software as a Service) companies in 2025 using **Python** for data cleaning and exploration, and **Power BI** for dynamic dashboards. It showcases my end-to-end capabilities in real-world data analytics, insight generation, and business intelligence reporting.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The goal is to uncover business insights, identify high-growth companies, detect valuation anomalies, and visualize key performance metrics across industries, regions, and funding stages. This project aims to simulate real-world analytical workflows in a business intelligence setting, showcasing both technical skills and strategic thinking.

To extract strategic insights, identify high-growth companies, and evaluate investment opportunities from a real-world SaaS dataset using data analysis and visualization.

**Key Questions:**
- What are the top-performing SaaS companies by ARR and Valuation?
- Which countries and categories dominate the SaaS landscape?
- Are there undervalued companies with high ARR but low valuation?
- How do funding stages and founding years affect company performance?
